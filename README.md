<h1> Telecommunications Project for Winter School </h1>

This project utilizes various technologies to create a comprehensive telecommunications solution. Below are the key technologies employed:
<li>Backend (BE): Quarkus</li>
<li>Frontend (FE): React</li>
<li>Code Analysis (BE & FE): SonarCloud</li>
<li>Containerization: Docker</li>
<li>Continuous Integration: Github Actions</li>
<li>Database: PostgreSQL</li>

<h2>Technologies Overview</h2>

<h3>Backend (BE): Quarkus</h3>
The backend of this project is developed using Quarkus, a powerful and lightweight Java framework that is optimized for container-first, cloud-native development.

<h3>Frontend (FE): React</h3>
The frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and efficient user interfaces.

<h3>Code Analysis with SonarCloud</h3>
Both the backend and frontend code undergo thorough custom analysis using SonarCloud. This helps in maintaining code quality, identifying potential issues, and ensuring best practices are followed in the development process.

<h3>Dockerization</h3>
The backend of the project is containerized using Docker, enabling consistent deployment across different environments. Docker containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, streamlining deployment and scalability. Please note that, due to time constraints, Dockerization has been implemented only for the backend.
<h3>Continuous Integration with Github Actions</h3>
Github Actions is employed for continuous integration, automating the build and testing processes. This ensures that any changes made to the codebase are automatically validated, maintaining the integrity of the project.

<h3>Database: PostgreSQL</h3>
The project utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage and management. This relational database enhances data integrity and provides a robust foundation for the backend.

<h3>Unit Tests</h3>
The project includes unit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of both the backend and frontend components. These tests ensure that the application behaves as expected and helps in identifying potential issues early in the development process.

<h3>Workshop Note: Platform Cypress</h3>
During the workshop, we explored the use of Cypress for end-to-end testing. While the platform Cypress was discussed, due to time constraints, its implementation is pending in the current version of the project.
